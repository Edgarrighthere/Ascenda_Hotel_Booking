Use Case 1: Backend Unit Testing
Main Flow: 
    1. Customer opens search page.
    2. System prompts the customer to input search variables.
    3. Customer inputs the variables.
    4. System validates variables.
    5. System fetches information from the API.
    6. System filters and sorts the hotels returned according to customer input.
    7. System displays a list of hotels that match the input criteria.
    8. Customer selects a hotel.
    9. The use case ends.

Alternative Flow:
    4a. Customer inputs invalid details. (Invalid destination, invalid check-in & check-out date)
        1. System prompts user to re-enter information
        2. Customer corrects the destination name.
        3. The use case continues from step 2.
    5a. There are no hotels that match the input criteria.
        1. System displays an error message, prompting the user to change a certain variable.
        2. The use case ends.

Things to test:
    - Whether input search variables are valid
    - Whether there is information fetched from the API
    - URL generated based on inputs
